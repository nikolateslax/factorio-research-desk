# Research Desk #

A mod for Factorio

This fork incorporates fixes from [U.N.Owen](https://mods.factorio.com/user/U.N.Owen) on the Factorio mod portal, as well as my own fixes.

### What does it do? ###

Adds a new item, the Research Desk, which allows the player to manually research
technologies. Requires no power, but the player must stand at the desk.

Most of the early-game items, which were previously available at startup, have
moved into the tech tree. Since power is no longer required for early research,
these new technologies may be hand-researched by using the desk like a Lab.

Your Research Desk does not have restrictions on which science packs can be
used, allowing manual research all the way into end game (if you are weird
enough to wish to do that). Since it's just a desk, no Modules can be used.

Manual research is faster than Lab research (you are smart!), but this method
is not extensible since a player must stand at the desk. Players may not share
desks (research speed is not increased if multiple players are there), but
multiple desks may be built. Bring your friends along for an army of manual
researchers!
